          # Ideally we would like to be able to test the freshness of the table in order to make sure that the
          # ingestion has run successfully. It is usually done on a timestamp given by the loader (fivetran, airbyte,
          # stitch...). For the sake of this exercise we use the created_at column but we usually do not use a
          #timestamp that contain business logic for this. Same remark for the raw_invoices.
